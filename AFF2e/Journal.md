**Scene 1**
**Chaos Factor:** 5
**Event Focus:** PC Negative
**Event Meaning:** Recruit Wishes

Fulvio is released by a wealthy but shady patron with a condition: Assassinate a Priest of Fulkra, the God of Travellers. Fulvio has no way to refuse his fortune, good of bad and on he sets into the streets of Port Blacksand to start his quest.

Location in Port Blacksand (1d8 = 3): Execution Hill District

Fulvio is looking for someone in the Execution Hill District of Port Blacksand when he enters (3d6 = 11) the Red Lantern Tavern.  

Is Fulvio recognised as a criminal by one of the patrons? Likely (83) NO

He slinks down into one of the tables and asks one of the three half-elf sisters for any signs of a priest of Fulkra, the God of Travellers.

Does she know Guldin? 50/50 (37) YES

"I think I know who you're talking about, but was is it to you?" she says. 

TEST SKILL (8) FAIL.

Fulvio is at a loss. He can't really explain that he's trying to find this man in order to kill him. He isn't exactly a cutthroat either. "I..."

"You don't seem to have good intentions towards this man, perhaps you should take your leave, unless I should call the guards on you."

Without looking like he's in a rush Fulvio takes his leave and goes out into the street. He goes next door into (3d6 = 10) the Gargoyle Tavern.

He approaches the counter to ask the owner, Renwick Redfoot about Guldin. (UNE Neutral Relationship 73 -> Sociable).
Does Renwick know Guldin? 50/50 (65) NO
Without any luck again, Fulvio steps out into the streets of Port Blacksand once again.
(Cities Random Event 80/16 Non-Human: A mage in animal form).

As Fulvio walks the streets of the Execution Hill District he sees a dog looking at him curiously. 

Is the dog hostile? 50/50 (1) Exceptional Yes

The dog growls and jumps, attacking Fulvio immediately and he notices that it's actually a wolf and not a dog that is suddenly upright and clawing at Fulvio.

WEREWOLF 8/9

SKILL test with ACROBATICS to evade attack -> 8 = 7+1 Success barely.

The werewolf's claws barely miss Fulvio's arm.

**Round 1:**
Fulvio: 7 + 1 (Swords) + 8 = 16
Werewolf: 8 + 9 = 15
Fulvio hits the werewolf for 1 STAMINA
**Round 2:**
Fulvio: 7 + 1 (Swords) + 3 = 10
Werewolf: 8 + 11 = 19
Werewolf hits Fulvio for 2 STAMINA
**Round 3:**
Fulvio: 7 + 1 (Swords) + 6 = 14
Werewolf: 8 + 6 = 14
**Round 4:**
Fulvio: 7 + 1 + 5 = 13
Werewolf: 8 + 10 = 18
Werewolf hits Fulvio for 2 STAMINA
**Round 5:**
Fulvio tries to escape: SKILL 4 < 7+1 (Acrobatics) Success

Fulvio escapes from the Werewolf knowing that it would be impossible to fight it. Why would he be ambushed by the Werewolf. Was the Werewolf sent by his shady patron to keep him in line?
He also needs to roll on his LUCK again to find out if he was infected with Lycanthropy 8 < 11 Success

He was very lucky in that the wounds seem to not have infected him. He performs First Aid on himself 7 < 8 Success and recovers 2 STAMINA. He also eats a meal and recovers another 2 STAMINA.

Without any clues as to where to look for Guldin next, Fulvio wanders aimlessly the streets of the Execution Hill district again (3d6 = 12). He enters the Four Way Cross tavern.
This is a notorious thief hangout, does someone recognise Fulvio? Likely (64) YES

"Fulvio, I thought you're rotting inside a cell," the bartender says. 
Fulvio explains that he has been let go with a condition and would like to get some help, if possible. He explains to the bartender he's on the market to hire someone to help him dispose of his target.
"That seems...dangerous," the bartender replies. "It will cost you," he says.
Fulvio offers 5 GP to bribe the bartender to point him in the direction of someone who may help him.
SKILL 7 + 1 (bribe) == 8 Success
The bartender paws the money and leans down to Fulvio, lowering his voice. "See that man down there," he points to a corner. "He'll help you, for the right price," he says before going back to pour ale.

Fulvio approaches the man in question. He's a (1d6) warrior clearly shown by the large axe by his side.
UNE (unseemly clairvoyant). He has some strange tattoos on his forearms and face and as soon as Fulvio approached he looked him in the eye and said, "You should not kill that man."
Fulvio couldn't hide his astonishment at the man, who clearly possesses some weird ability that allowed him to see.
"My name is Oulk," the man said.

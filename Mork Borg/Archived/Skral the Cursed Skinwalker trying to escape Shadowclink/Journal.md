Skral died in Scheslwig, in the arms of his lover, Kutz. His goal is to find her again and regain her love. He doesn't remember why he died and who killed him. His only memory is of Kutz clutching him in her milky white arms.

Next thing Skral remembers is waking up chained in a cell. The Hall of Sorrows. 
He holds his breath and tenses up leaving a small amount of room to escape from his chains but he cries in agony as a rib is broken. 

In a corner he finds a rotten bag with a number of things that must belong to him [Starting Equipment].

Armed and ready Skral sets out to escape this rotting prison through the west side.

[Reaction 11 Helpful] 
A jailer appears in the corner and smiles, "So we've got ourselves an escapee". Skral looks in his purse. [Bribe DR8 vs 12/4 Weak Hit]
The jailer looks at his side and decides that he wants a piece of the action. [d10 * 10 = 90 silver]
"Perhaps 90 pieces of silver can help me look the other way," he says.
Skral hands over the coins and without a word passing through his lips he hurries down the corridor.
Skral enter a sickly crypt with 2 exits with some bony remains in the corner. Without anything of interest he moves on.

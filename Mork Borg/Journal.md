Aren flees from his bedroom as soon as news of his father, Zigmund, King Fathmu's brother has been killed.

His father had given him an ancient puzzle cube, "for a case of utmost urgency" and Aren fiddles with it, his hands tracing the puzzle, locks and mechanical wheels turning and turning.

Suddenly, something clicks. A sense of dread fills Aren.
[Roll 3d12 = 8 7 10]
A blindingly white creature with a face like a rotting-intestine, covered in what looks like to be its own spawn of vermin like small versions of this abomination starts appearing out of a portal of light that emanates from the puzzle cube.
[Puzzle Box Abomination HP 4; Morale 10; Armor -d6; Damage d8]

Aren drops the cube to the floor. [Initiative 1d6 = 4]
Without waiting for any answers Aren quickly surmises that something was wrong with the puzzle cube his father left for him. Whatever the old man intended for him this surely couldn't be it or could it?
[Round 1]
[DR 12 vs 18 + 1] Aren raises his flail and strikes at the abomination with all his might, hitting it right in its hideous maw. [d8 = 6] The creature's hide is no match for the iron that [d6 = 1] quickly makes a mass of puree out of its flesh [-5 HP].

Aren needs to escape from Schleswig and search for his father's wandering corpse in the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead for clues to his killer, so that he can avenge him.

[Begin an Adventure - Depressing (4)
* Travel to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead
* Find Zigmund's Corpse
* Find Zigmund's Killer
* Avenge Zigmund]

**Travel to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead**

There are two routes from Schleswig to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead. [Feretory distances halved for smaller world]
Route 1:
* [d10+4 = 6] to Bergen Chrypt 
* [d8+1 = 5] to Valley of Unfortunate Undead
Route 2:
* [d6+2 = 4] to Galgenbeck
* [d6+3 = 8] to Valley of Unfortunate Undead

Aren ponders the misery ahead of him, 11 or 12 days of travel, no matter the waypoint. He can choose to travel the shorter route via Bergen Chrypt or the longer route to Galgenbeck, where he could resupply himself.
Thinking that he'll do well on his own Aren opts for travelling via Bergen Chrypt. It will be a dangerous journey so he sets out.
[Undertake a Journey to Bergen Chrypt - 6 days, we'll do 3 in Wastland and 3 in BC]

[Day 1 - Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 2]
[Weather - d12 = 10]
An irritating drizzle falls from the dark sky, plastering Aren's face with foul tasting rain.
[Road - d8 = 1]
Aren follows an almost forgotten dirt track leading out west from the city in the direction of the mountains. [Since it's close to the city it makes no sense for Aren to lose direction.]
[Road even - d20 = 19]
It's not long until Aren sees a funeral procession of toothless villagers, carrying a very large coffin. 
[Crowd Size - d4 = 4 Massive]
[3d6 = 306 + 400 = 700]
[50/50 are they hostile to Aren - d20 = 11 Yes]
The enormous crowd of villagers see Aren and start saying something. A few seem to be armed with rudimentary weapons and jump Aren.
[GAM with Agility to Run away DR12 vs 10/6 +1 Fail]
Aren looks around but the crowd has already engulfed him. He has no chance but to surrender to the villagers. 
He's taken to the procession leader, Jotna, a Fanatical Mercenary. 
"Where did you think you were going, getting in the way of the Cult of Necrotic Masonry?"
"I never heard or you, nor do I intend to stay. Leave me be and I'll be out of your way quickly."
[GAM with Presence to convince Jotna to let Aren go DR12 vs 17/15 Strong Hit]
"I see. You're a puny pawn in all that is to come. However what can you offer in order for us to let you leave?"
[d6 against equipment = 2 Flail]
"I see you have that beautiful flail. It will come in handy when we mash up this giant into blocks for our cathedral. Hand it over and you shall pass."
Without much choice, Aren hands over his flail and quickly takes his leave.
Aren reaches what he feels is a good place to pitch his tent for the night.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 6/19 Weak Hit]
Aren eats but sleeps badly, tormented by dreams of his father's ghost. 
[Night Event d12 = 12]
At some point he's awaken by [d4 = 4 + 2 = 6] peddlers with a donkey and sooty lanterns. 
[Reaction 2d6 = 5] 
The peddlers seem angry with something. Aren tries to pacify them by offering them some water.
[GAM with Presence DR12 vs 17/4 Weak Hit]
The peddlers take the water, take a look around and see nothing else worth asking Aren about. The rest of the night goes by.
[Travel 1/6 Complete]

[Day 2]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 2 ]
[Weather d12 = 3]
Today the drizzle is gone, and is replaced by a piercing wind that flails any exposed skin.
[Road d8 = 6]
Aren follows a well-used road west. The mountains loom larger with each day.
[Road event d20 = 15]
A group of mercenaries with [d8 = 6] guards appear to be guarding some control post in the road ahead.
[GAM with Agility to skirt around them DR12 vs 11/7 + 1 Weak Hit]
[Spend 1 omen to reroll 7 = 15 Strong Hit]
Aren quickly falls by the side of the road and gives the group a wide berth. Better safe than sorry, he thinks, having had enough of mercenaries for two days. Later in the day he finds a good spot to pitch his tent.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 13/9 Weak Hit]
[Night event d12 = 5]
A quiet night passes without incident.
[Travel 2/6 Complete]

[Day 3]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 1]
A new dawn and a new misery arrives.
2:3 And from the Spears: a frost. Born from Bergen Chrypt and covering all.
[Weather d12 = 1]
A lifeless grey paints the new morning. As soon as Aren gets up though a frost seems to roll down from the mountains to which he's headed. 
[GAM with Toughness DR12 vs 3/9 Fail]
Aren feels the chill sink into his bones. [d4 = -2 HP]
"Blasted misery," he murmurs under his breath, which turned icy before setting out for the day. Not having any food left he sets out to forage.
[Foraging d6 = 3]
Aren does well, finding [d6 = 1 + 3] food for 4 days' worth.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 18/19 Strong Hit]
Aren recovers [d6 = 4 HP] and feels fully rested.

[Day 4]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 9]
[Weather d12 = 5]
The morning forgot to appear, Aren observes. The day is as black as night. "It will be good to leave Wastland behind and enter the mountains," he says to himself.
[Road d8 = 8]
Aren finally enter a paved road. Afraid that he may find some of the King's soldiers he hurries along.
[Road event d20 = 3]
Nothing particular happens and Aren sets out to make camp for the night at the entrance of Bergen Chrypt.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 17/18 Strong Hit]
[Travel 3/6 Complete]

[Day 5]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 3]
[Weather d12 = 1]
Another grey day, devoid of life, appropriate for a trek in the Bergen Chrypt.
[Road d8 = 1]
Aren pick up his backpack and sets off through a dirt track leading up through the mountains .
[Road event d20 = 12]
A religious procession of flagellants and hermits.
[Crowd size d4 = 3]
A large crowd of about [d100 = 10 + 30 = 40] people seem to be coming [Up/Down d4 = 1] up the road in the same direction as Aren. He reaches to them and engages in conversation.
[Reaction 2d6 = 7]
The person that Aren talks to seems to be indifferent to him. They are as if hipnotized and care nothing for Aren.
Aren can't get anything out of them and eventually passes them on his way to a cave to set camp for the night.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 15/1]
[Spent 2 omens and got 11/2 Weak Hit]
Recover 1 omen
[Night event d12 = 5]
Nothing happens tonight.
[Travel 4/6 Complete]

[Day 6]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 3]
[Weather d12 = 10]
An irritating drizzle cover the tent while Aren sets everything into the backpack. The cold wind blows up here and the passes will only get trickier.
[Road d8 = 5]
He sets out through a trade road fallen into disrepair. 
[Road event d20 = 10]
After a few hours of journey, Aren sees a monastery by the side of the road. He can hear chants coming from inside. 
[Does Aren recognize the chant to Nechrubel GAM DR10 with Presence = 18/9 Weak Hit]
He recognizes the familiar chanting to Nechrubel but doesn't mean what it's for. 
Approaching the monastery, he opens the doors leading into the courtyard.
[Microcrawl d4 = 2]
The monastery is small enough that it appears to have only a single large structure after the courtyard.
[Reaction 2d6 = 8]
The monk and nuns inside seem indifferent to Aren as he enters the room.
[Excavated Chamber]
The room appears to have been carved from the rock face of the mountain.
[Sound d12 = 11] The rhythmic sound that the monks make accompanies Aren as he slowly wanders into the chamber.
[Odours & Tastes d20 = 18] A fermented scent wafts into Aren's nostrils. Clearly the monks make some kind of brew in this space. Perhaps the brew puts them into a trance that induces the chanting to Nechrubel.
[Room Contents d12 = 2]
Inside Aren observes curiously the remains of a strange object.
[Material Quality d20 = 1] The object appears to glow and the eerie light that emanates form it casts eldritch shadows across the chamber.
[Material Composition d12 = 8] Upon further inspection Aren notices that it's a strange jewel that seems to pulse with the rhythm of the chanting from the monks.
[Crowd Size d4 = 3; d100 = 33 + 30]
A rough count of the room shows around sixty monks and nuns chanting to this strange glowing jewel. 
A brief thought of stealing this magical artefact runs through Aren's mind, but he quickly puts it back where it should stay. There's no reason to it. Unless...
[Ask one monk if the jewel allows them to talk to the dead 50/50 2d6 = Yes but]
[Oracle = Transform Dream]
"We speak to the dead, but we must enter our dreams, transform them into reality. Do you wish to do so?" the pale monk asks Aren.
"Yes, I seek to speak with my father. He was murdered a few days ago."
"I see," the monk replies. He walks over to the corner where a vat of the brew emanates a stink that forces Aren to pinch his nose. 
"Drink this and embrace the dream," the monk says, while holding a wooden cup filled to the brim with the stinking brew.
[Does the brew have a side effect? 50/50 2d6 = Yes But]
As soon as Aren drinks he feels something pulling him under.
[GAM with Toughness DR12 vs 10/8 Fail]
A cramp takes over him, and he seems to be losing some of his vitality, [d4 = -3HP]
[Microcrawl d4 = 1]
[Room Description = 9/9] A bleak shrine stand in front of Aren. 
[Room Contents d12 = 12] At first glance, it appears empty.
Aren looks around, trying to find out a secret or trap.
[Search DR12 vs 19/18 + 1 Strong Hit]
As if revealing to him, a stone opens to reveal [Tenebrous Reliquary 2d6 = 6/2] a set of eyes and teeth. They are suspiciously similar to his father's.
Aren comes back to himself, a set of eyes and teeth on his hands.
"You have been successful, I see, " the monk says and gives Aren a hideous grin.
[Spend 1 Omen to lower DR -4]
[Use Eyes and Teeth - DR10 vs 15 Success]
[Replace d4 / 2 = 2 eyes]
[Eyes d4 = 4] Aren feels his sight enhanced with some power beyond the grave. The new set of eyes twitches and then fades. 
[Replace d10 = 1 teeth]
[Teeth d4 = 4] The single teeth is pointy and Aren feels its edge with a finger, quickly taking it out. A sharp fang, can come handy in close range combat.
Without much more to do in this monastery Aren decides to leave and continue his journey, in search of a place to camp in the mountains for the day.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 18/7 Weak Hit]
Recover [d6 = 3 HP] health during the night and 1 omen.
[Night event d12 = 11]
Most of the night goes by until a band of albino cultists passes by singing eerie hymns to their alligator goddess.
[Reaction 2d6 = 8] They pass by, indifferent to Aren and continue on their way.
[Travel 5/6 Complete]

[Day 7]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 7]
[Weather d8 = 3]
Dawn of a new day and a piercing wind in the Bergen Chrypt mountains slashes though Aren's robes.
Without any food left, Aren sets out to forage something in the mountains.
[Foraging d6 = 4]
Aren follows a set of tracks in the snow. A weird native of the mountains, a Ragpie. 
[Ragpie HP 8, Morale -, Thick Skin -d2, Special Smother Cloak]
[Round 1]
[DR10 vs 12 + 1 Hit]
[d6 = 2 + 1 damage]
[Spend 1 omen to deal maximum damage = 7]
[d4/2 = -1 HP] Aren's blade sinks into the Ragpie for [-6HP]
[DR10 vs 15 + 1 No Hit] Aren's is able to escape the Ragpie.
[Round 2]
[DR10 vs 14 + 1 Hit]
[d6 = 2 + 1 damage]
[d4/2 = -2 HP] Aren's blade this time only grazes the Ragpie for [-1 HP]
[DR10 vs 20 + 1 Crit] Aren quickly gets out of the way and counter attacks the Ragpie [DR10 vs 8 + 1 No Hit] but his blade misses the target
[Round 3]
[DR10 vs 15 + 1 Hit]
[d6 = 3 + 1 damage]
[d4/2 = -1 HP] Aren finishes the Ragpie with a final thrust of his ancestor's blade for [-3 HP]
He sets out to quarter the beast for food, yieldind a goot portion for tonight and enough food for [Rations = 8] days. In the belly of the beast he also finds a priest's remains. 
[Is there a scroll 50/50 2d6 = 12 Yes]  There are actually [d4/2 = 2] scrolls.
[d4/2 = 1 Unclean Scroll d10 = 7] Metzhuotl Blind Your Eye
[d4/2 = 1 Unclean Scroll d10 = 2] 
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 14/3 Weak Hit]
The night goes by, and Aren recovers 1 omen and rests well.
[Night event d12 = 10]
Aren dreams of a bright white nothingness [Reduce Omens by d6 = 3 - 3 = 0] but apart from that nothing happens.

[Day 8]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 1]
[Weather d8 = 3]
The same piercing wind persists up in the mountains. Yet today a new misery arrives in the world bringing with it lashing rain and a darkness that covers all.
3:5 Then shall come rain unending and the day shall be made night by its coming.
[Road d8 = 6] Finally, a well-used road that Aren can follow in the mountains. An ominous tablet hangs from a dead branch of a tree pointing the way to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead.
[Road Event d20 = 12]
Another religious procession with around [Crowd Size d4 = 4] 500 people from what Aren can gather is going by.
[Reaction 2d6 = 9]
As Aren approaches one of the flagellants they are almost friendly, smiling a toothless grin at Aren.
"What are you flagellating for," Aren asks.
[Religious Denominations 3d12 = 7/5/12] "We are the Penitents of the Oneiric Druidry"
"Druids that dream," Aren asks, curious. "Do you dream the dreams of the dead?"
[Likely 2d6 = 3 + 2 No] "We don't. Our dreams are [Weaken Time] of the end of times and the glories that await us. We can hardly expect."
Aren takes his leave of another strange cult and sets out on his journey, looking for another place to camp.
[Camp with Presence DR12 vs 4/8 Fail]
Aren has a terrible night and gets no rest. [Night Event d12 = 4]
[Action/Theme = Challenge Greed]
Aren spends the night thinking of the many ways that his father's life has led itself to accumulating wealth. Could it be that it was because of this greed that he was killed? Another clue to the mystery.
[Travel 6/6 Complete]

[Day 9]
[Calendar of Nechrubel - d10 = 2]
[Weather d8 = 1]
Another morning of lifeless grey skies as Aren begins the descent into the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead. Another five days' worth of travelling there.

# You are Aren

Things were going so well, until King Fathmu IX's brother Zigmund, your father, was murdered.  
  
Bowed down only by the memories of your own lost glory, you could never submit to anyone else. Not you, of noble blood! (Not that you expect any of these peons to understand the depths of your sorrow.)

Abrasive and shallow. Hands caked with sores. Unable to get to the point. You have never actually finished a story. A puzzle cube has been calibrated incorrectly (or has it?), awakening a slumbering abomination.

# Wretched Royalty

**"Poltroon" the Court Jester**

While practically useless, personally irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon's capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat. For the first two rounds you and your allies get +2 on attack/defence.

**The Blade of your Ancestors**

This magnificent and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable and quietly despises you. It taunts your failures and, if continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to ‘accidentally' attack you or your companions. Deals d6+1 damage. Attack/Defence DR is 10.

**Sight Beyond Sight**
Test DR10 with Presence for eyes to twitch in danger's presence - it's not YOUR eye though, it can lie

**Fangs**
Gain bite attack (d6 damage, on 1-2 enemy gets a free attack)

**Miseries** 2/7
2:3 And from the Spears: a frost. Born from Bergen Chrypt and covering all.
3:5 Then shall come rain unending and the day shall be made night by its coming.
